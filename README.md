# i_Hack
Code for email-spam detection under the software track, given by Pepipost, at E-Summit, IIT Bombay.

This project involves classification of E-mails into, whether it is a spam or a ham. It uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), using TensorFlow framework, and other supporting Python libraries. Also implements the extraction of the 'body part' and 'domain source' from a G-Mail.

P.S - The Data is not uploaded here. I will soon upload it in Google Drive, and share the link.

Improvements :-

1. Multiclassification of emails (Personal, Social, etc...)
2. Integrating a GUI for displaying the results, with help of PyJs, or other Js integrators.
3. Optimizing the algo, by replacing ANNs with Recurrent Neural Networks. (Will upload this protoype soon).

Feel free to contribute !!
